# mastermind
I want to use Python to investigate effective algorithms for the codebreaker in generalized Mastermind, i.e., Mastermind with n code pegs of m colors (instead of 4 code pegs of 6 colors). 
## Step 1: calculate_key
Step 1 is implementing the calculation of the number of black and white pegs (key pegs) given a hidden code and a guess. For debugging and for the fun of it, I've turned it into a game mami.py where you play generalized Mastermind as codebreaker against the computer (with a randomized hidden code).
